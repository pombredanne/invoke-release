4.1.0 (2019-07-18)
------------------
- [MINOR] Add support for pushing to a branch and not tag
  Some projects don't support pushing directly to master without going through a pull request. This new flow, if configured (the existing flow is unchanged), will:
  - Create a branch named `invoke-release-<base branch>-<new_version>`
  - Push the branch to origin
  - Not create a tag
  A future change will add support for automatically creating the pull request. Users of this flow will typically create some kind of build bot that will verify the pull request, automatically merge it, and create and push a tag.

1.2.1 (2016-01-22)
------------------
- Fixed a bug Senna discovered: If path to Vim doesn't exist, a different error is thrown.

1.2.0 (2016-01-21)
------------------
- Fixed issue with release tool using vi instead of vim by default and vi being linked differently in path
  - Changed the default from `vi` to `vim`, because it has been established that a `vi` command linked to a non-`vim` executable doesn't work.
  - Added the ability to specify an Invoke Release-specific editor environmental variable that doesn't conflict with other applications' use of `$EDITOR`.
  - Added exception checking to suggest using the environmental variable if an editor fails to launch.
  - Improved error messages for other command error messages, because `CalledProcessError` never has a value for `e.message`.

1.1.1 (2015-12-09)
------------------
- Made file exist checks case-sensitive, because Git is always case sensitive, even though Mac OS X's file system isn't. As a result, if the file was named `CHANGELOG.TXT`, and the release tool called `git add CHANGELOG.txt`, Git would silently fail to add the file without any error codes, and the release tool would incorrectly succeed with a partial release.
- Fixed a typo in the changelog editor comments.
